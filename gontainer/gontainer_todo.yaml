# The following parameters and services MUST be defined and configured in the execution time.
# We cannot define them here because these are dynamic ones. They depend on the input provided to the command.
#
# If these params and services weren't defined explicitly as TODO, the command `gontainer build` would have reported such errors:
#     output.ValidateParamsExist: "@inputValidator": param "version" does not exist
#     output.ValidateParamsExist: "@stepCodeGenerator": param "outputFile" does not exist
#     output.ValidateParamsExist: "@stepReadConfig": param "inputPatterns" does not exist
#     output.ValidateParamsExist: "@templateWithBuildInfo": param "buildInfo" does not exist
#     output.ValidateServicesExist: "printer": service "writer" does not exist
#
# Another solution would be using the following flags:
#  - ignore-missing-params
#  - ignore-missing-services

parameters:
  version: "%todo()%"
  buildInfo: "%todo()%"
  inputPatterns: "%todo()%"
  outputFile: "%todo()%"

services:
  writer:
    todo: true
